AI-Powered Threat Detection System
A machine learning-based cybersecurity framework that identifies and mitigates potential threats in cloud environments. This system integrates with SIEM tools for real-time monitoring and alerting.
Features

ML-Based Threat Detection: Uses advanced machine learning models to detect anomalous patterns and potential security threats
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously analyzes cloud environment activity for immediate threat detection
SIEM Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Splunk for comprehensive security information and event management
Automated Mitigation: Provides automated response options to contain identified threats
Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle enterprise-scale cloud deployments on AWS
Customizable Rules: Allows security teams to define custom detection rules alongside ML capabilities

Tech Stack

Python 3.8+
TensorFlow 2.x
AWS (CloudWatch, Lambda, S3)
Splunk Enterprise Security
Docker

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
Splunk instance with proper API access
Docker and docker-compose (optional for containerized deployment)

Setup

Clone the repository:
bashCopygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-threat-detection.git
cd ai-threat-detection

Create and activate a virtual environment:
bashCopypython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:
bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt

Configure AWS and Splunk credentials:
bashCopycp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your credentials and settings

Initialize the ML models:
bashCopypython -m scripts.initialize_models


Usage
Training the Models
bashCopypython -m src.training.train_model --config config/training_config.yaml
Running the Threat Detection System
bashCopypython -m src.main --config config/config.yaml
Docker Deployment
bashCopydocker-compose up -d
Architecture
The system consists of several key components:

Data Collectors: Components that gather logs and events from AWS services
Preprocessor: Cleans and transforms raw data for ML processing
ML Engine: Core detection system using TensorFlow models
Rule Engine: Traditional rule-based detection for known patterns
Integrator: Combines ML and rule-based results
Responder: Executes automated mitigation actions
SIEM Connector: Interfaces with Splunk for advanced alerting and visualization
